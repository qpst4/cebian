### Post Body (Markdown)

Hi everyone,

Like many of you on larger Android phones, I've always loved **Samsung's One Hand Operation+ (OHO+)** and reachability tools like **Quick Cursor**, but hated that OHO+ is vendor-locked to Samsung and many other gesture/floating tools are proprietary, filled with subscriptions, or abandoned.

Over the past few months, I built **Cebian** (formerly "Sidebar"), an all-in-one open-source (AGPL-3.0) gesture and productivity app designed to bring desktop-class single-handed navigation and quick actions to any Android 12+ device.

### 🌟 What makes Cebian unique?

1. **Samsung OHO+ Style Edge Gestures on ANY Device**:
   - Customizable left/right/top/bottom trigger bars with multi-angle swipes (straight, diagonal up/down, long-swipe holds).
   - Dedicated landscape handles (auto-adjust for media/gaming).
   - Radial, honeycomb, and bubble launcher menus with fluid damping and real-time Gaussian blur.

2. **Reachability Pointer (Quick Cursor Alternative)**:
   - Swipe from the screen edge to summon a floating joystick pointer, letting your thumb easily reach and click UI elements at the very top of large screens.

3. **Floating Ball with Local Offline OCR & Image Search (FooView Alternative)**:
   - Drag the floating ball to any text or image on screen.
   - Extracts text using accessibility hierarchy or falls back to **100% offline on-device OCR** (ML Kit / Tesseract / PaddleOCR ONNX).
   - Aggregated reverse image search (Google, Yandex, SauceNAO, TinEye, trace.moe, etc.) with preview window.

4. **Deep OEM & System Integration**:
   - Works with Accessibility Services, with optional **Shizuku / Root / LSPosed** privilege modes for bulletproof background persistence and non-exported activity launching.
   - Built-in Freeform window support (MIUI/HyperOS small windows, Meizu Flyme small windows, and native Android freeform).
   - SMS/OTP verification code automatic extraction and notification management.

5. **100% Free & Open Source**:
   - Licensed under **AGPL-3.0**.
   - Zero telemetry, zero analytics trackers, zero in-app purchases, and no ads forever.
   - Built with modern Kotlin 2.4 + Jetpack Compose + Miuix UI.
